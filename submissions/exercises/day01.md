|Because of the lack of color contrast, Lazada is at a disadvantage when a new user wants to find a product using the search bar. But browsing for products is easier because Flash Sales can already be seen without even scrolling. But it would be a different topic when accessing Lazada on mobile devices because despite showing many features, it does not feel overwhelming to new users. | vs | The color scheme of Shopee is a lot better than Lazada. Having alternate use of orange and white helps the new users make it much easier to locate the search bar. Even if there is an added feature of search recommendation, it does not distract the new users, instead, it helps to pop out where the search bar is and its purpose.  |
| Although the ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù categories are a great feature for ease of use, the location of it is a bit confusing. Considering that first-time users do not know anything about things around Lazada, they might not be able to identify that it was the category section. In addition, to truly locate the categories, users must scroll down or use the quick access panel in the far lower left of the screen, which a redundant within the features. |vs|img|
